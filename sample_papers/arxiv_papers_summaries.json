Scenethesis is a framework for text to interactive 3D scene generation. Given a text prompt, Scenethesis leverages both language and visual priors to generate realistic and physical plausible indoor and outdoor environments. Synthesizing interactive 3D Scene Planning  Scenethesis supports either a simple prompt (e. g. , “a peace- ful beach during sunset”) for flexible scene generation or a detailed prompt for controllable scene generation (e. , a scene plan describing the detailed spatial relations as shown in the appendix). For a simple prompt, the LLM gener- ates a coarse scene plan by reasoning over user input. It first interprets the prompt, reviews all object categories in the available 3D database, selects commonly associated ob- jects, and then generates an up-sampled prompt describing coarse spatial relations, as illustrated in Figure 3. When given detailed prompts, the LLM checks for the presence of all specified objects in the database, infers relevant object categories [13, 18, 21], and skips the prompt pro- cesses. PhyScene [47] incorporates physical constraints. However, interactive scene generation methods remain dataset-constrained, limiting generalization and often pro- ducing unrealistic compositions due to relaxed collision con- straints [41, 43].
